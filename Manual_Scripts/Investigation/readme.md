# Useful investigation scripts to enumerate the system

# Investigation Script
- Designed for CrowdStrike, but can run locally.
- Please be sure to replace the username placeholder with the target username you want to investigate.  Example below:

```
Windows
$username = "<USERNAME>" => $username = "admin"

MAC
username="<USERNAME>" => username="admin"
```

The Inspect script does not thoroughly investigate through the system.  The script is a light weight tool to quickly enumerate a host to identify suspicious activity.  You can use these as a starting point to assist you with your investigation.
